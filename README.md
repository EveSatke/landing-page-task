# Landing Page Task

A responsive landing page built with HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project includes a Swiper-based slider, modular SCSS structure, and a custom mobile navigation overlay.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Stack

- Vite to build to GitHub pages
- SCSS (modular partials)
- Swiper JS

## Tooling

- Prettier handles code formatting

## How I built it

- I started with the basic HTML structure to nail down the layout and content.
- Then I styled everything with SCSS, breaking pieces into smaller partials so I could tweak sections without losing track.
- After that I refactored the behavior into vanilla JavaScript files, splitting things like navigation, features, benefits, and FAQ so the content stays dynamic and easy to update.
- I double-checked the page in multiple browsers to make sure the layout and interactions look consistent.
- Overall I focused on keeping the project organized, with clear folders for scripts, styles, and components so future changes stay simple.
